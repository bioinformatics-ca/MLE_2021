## Python : 
You will need to be familiar with Python. You don't have to be fluent in it, but you should know enough to understand it. 
If you know Python, you can skip this section

## Google Colab:
We will be using Google Colab for the course. Students will need google accounts and a google drive - if they don't have one already. This allows us to do everything on the web. 
There are tutorials and videos on Colab and it would be good if the students spent a half hour or so getting familiar with it.

## SciKit Learn & TensorFlow :
 We will be using SciKit Learn and possibly TensorFlow (also Google products), which also allows us to do things on the web.
